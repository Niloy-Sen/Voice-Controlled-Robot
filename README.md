# Voice-Controlled-Robot
It uses Arduino and HC-05 Bluetooth Module to construct a voice controlled Robot.<br>
You have to install the Arduino Bluetooth Application on your phones, and connect it to the Bluetooth Module<br>
Your instruction should have a pattern like distance(in cm) followed by the direction. Eg. "20 forward" will mean that the robot will move 20cm in the forward direction.<br>
If you give any other instruction, an error message will be shown on the serial monitor.<br>
Components Required: 1.	Arduino UNO with cable<br>
                     2.	Bluetooth HC-05 Module<br>
                     3.	An L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor driver<br>
                     4.	Two-wheel robot chassis<br>
                     5.	Two dc motors<br>
                     6.	jumper wires<br>
                     7.	mini breadboard<br>
                     8.	9v battery (power bank) or Batteries<br>
                     9.	2 Battery clip connectors (1 connector must be suitable with dc jack on Arduino)<br>
                     10.	Speed sensor with encoder wheel.<br>
