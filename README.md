# Voice-Controlled-Robot
It uses Arduino and HC-05 Bluetooth Module to construct a voice controlled Robot.
You have to install the Arduino Bluetooth Application on your phones, and connect it to the Bluetooth Module
Your instruction should have a pattern like distance(in cm) followed by the direction. Eg. "20 forward" will mean that the robot will move 20cm in the forward direction
If you give any other instruction, an error message will be shown on the serial monitor.
Components Required: 1.	Arduino UNO with cable
                     2.	Bluetooth HC-05
                     3.	An L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor driver
                     4.	Two-wheel robot chassis
                     5.	Two dc motors
                     6.	jumper wires
                     7.	mini breadboard
                     8.	9v battery (power bank) or Batteries
                     9.	2 Battery clip connectors (1 connector must be suitable with dc jack on Arduino)
                     10.	Speed sensor with encoder wheel
